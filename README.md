# GMAIL EndGame
* Use Google's bulk delete API to delete more than 50 emails.
 
Seeing as some of us have had gmail accounts since the beginning.
I love my gmail username, but it's filled with 21 years worth of junk and subscriptions
that I didn't archive and I didn't want to keep.

### Get your API key here
1. https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
2. Save the .json file to the working directory of gmailendgame.py

### Install Required Modules
1. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located.
2. activate your virtualenv.
3. run: `pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell.`

Unlike Endgame, there's no going back. The delete is permanent. You will be asked to confirm
the delete, however, the response defaults to "no." -You're welcome

You will need to edit the script. See the queryString comment.
